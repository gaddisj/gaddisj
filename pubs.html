<p></p>

<!--	<p>Twisted generalized Weyl algebras (TGWAs) are a large family of algebras that includes several algebras of interest for ring theory and representation theory, such as Weyl algebras, primitive quotients of $U(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, and multiparameter quantized Weyl algebras. In this work, we study invariants of TGWAs under diagonal automorphisms. Under certain conditions, we are able to show that the fixed ring of a TGWA by such an automorphism is again a TGWA. In particular, this is true for $\Bbbk$-finitistic TGWAs of type $(A_1)^n$ and $A_2$. We apply this theorem to study properties of the fixed ring, such as the noetherian property and simplicity. We also look at the behavior of simple weight modules for TGWAs when restricted to the action of the fixed ring. As an auxiliary result, in order to study invariants of tensor products of TGWAs, we prove that the class of regular, $\mu$-consistent TGWAs is closed under tensor products.</p>-->

<!--	<p>In the paper, we study the invariant theory for quadratic Poisson algebras. Let $G$ be a finite group of the graded Poisson automorphisms of a quadratic Poisson algebra $A$. When the Poisson bracket of $A$ is skew-symmetric, a Poisson version of the Shephard-Todd-Chevalley theorem is proved stating that the fixed Poisson subring $A^G$ is skew-symmetric if and only if $G$ is generated by reflections. For many other well-known families of quadratic Poisson algebras, we show that $G$ contains limited or even no reflections. This kind of Poisson rigidity result ensures that the corresponding fixed Poisson subring $A^G$ is not isomorphic to $A$ as Poisson algebras unless $G$ is trivial.</p>-->

<!--	<p>Quantum linear spaces are a large class of pointed Hopf algebras that include the Taft algebras and their generalizations.

These are then used to determine (semi)primeness of certain smash products with quantum affine spaces. This extends Bergen's work on Taft algebras.</p>-->

We define the type (M, P, d) of such an algebra A, where M is the incidence matrix of the quiver, P is the permutation matrix giving the action of the Nakayama automorphism of A on the vertices of the quiver, and d is the degree of the superpotential. We study the question of what possible types can occur under the additional assumption that A has polynomial growth. In particular, we are able to give a nearly complete answer to this question when Q has at most 3 vertices.</p>-->

	A general criterion is given for when the center of a Taft algebra smash product is the fixed ring. This is applied to the study of the noncommutative discriminant. Our method relies on the Poisson methods of Nguyen, Trampel, and Yakimov, but also makes use of Poisson Ore extensions. Specifically, we fully determine the inner faithful actions of Taft algebras on quantum planes and quantum Weyl algebras. We compute the discriminant of the corresponding smash product and apply it to compute the Azumaya locus and restricted automorphism group.
